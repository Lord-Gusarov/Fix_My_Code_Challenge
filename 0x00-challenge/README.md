## Background Context
Fix my code is a new type of project, where we’ll jump into an existing code base and fix it!
Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not.
Please download the repository [0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge](https://github.com/holbertonschool/0x00-Fix_My_Code_Challenge) and use it as initial files for all solutions.
You should not recode everything, just fix it!
